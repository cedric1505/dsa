# : wave : Hi!!!
# : Github is cool!!

While I have little background in data structures 
and algorithms, I am eager to build my foundation 
from the ground up. I am most interested in 
understanding how and when to apply this and that 
kind of stuffs. I am excited to learn all that I 
could in this semester about the principles of 
DSA. Not just solving abstract problems but also 
to make my algorithms and codes become more 
efficient and effective! 

Also, I want to learn some tips and tricks on how 
to become a world renowned data scientist!! ðŸ¤“ðŸ’»

Oh, again!! github sure is cool, I want to 
explore it more!!
